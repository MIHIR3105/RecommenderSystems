# E-Commerce Recommender System & Pattern Mining

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a personalized recommendation system and pattern mining for e-commerce data. The system utilizes **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** and **Association Rule Mining** to suggest relevant products to users.

## Features Implemented
- **Data Preprocessing & Exploration**: Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommending products based on user similarity (Cosine Similarity).
- **Association Rule Mining**: Extracting frequent item sets and generating association rules using the Apriori algorithm.
- **Visualization & Analysis**: Graphical insights into user behavior and recommendations.

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib networkx mlxtend
```

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Ensure Required Files are Available**:
   - Place `ecommerce_user_data.csv` and `product_details.csv` in the same directory as `project_notebook.ipynb`.
2. **Run the Notebook Automatically**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook project_notebook.ipynb
     ```
   - Execute all cells in sequence to generate recommendations and insights.

## Expected Output
- **User-Based Recommendations**: List of top products recommended per user.
- **Association Rules**: Insights into frequently purchased product combinations.
- **Visualizations**: Heatmaps, network graphs, and trend analysis plots.
